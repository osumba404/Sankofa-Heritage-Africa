## 🌍 **Sankofa – Heritage Africa**

### *Discover. Preserve. Experience.*

---


**Sankofa** is an Akan term from Ghana meaning *“go back and fetch what you have forgotten.”* It symbolizes **honoring the past, preserving knowledge, and reclaiming cultural roots**, which perfectly aligns with the platform’s goal of safeguarding Africa’s oral histories and traditions.

**Heritage Africa** emphasizes the **scope and focus of the platform**, highlighting that it celebrates and preserves the continent’s **rich, diverse cultural legacy**.

Together, the name conveys a **mission-driven, culturally authentic, and globally understandable identity**. It communicates respect for the past while inspiring **youth engagement, digital storytelling, and cultural exploration across Africa**.

---

### 🔹 **Concept:**

A pan-African digital platform where communities **document their cultural heritage and invite the world to explore it virtually.** Elders, youth, and creators collaborate to tell the story of their people, places, and traditions — through videos, audio, and immersive experiences.

It’s part **digital archive**, part **tourism guide**, and part **youth storytelling project**.
